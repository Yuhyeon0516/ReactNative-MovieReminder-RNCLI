After running the app, the first screen shows a list of released movies in a `Flatlist`.<br/>
At the bottom, a banner advertisement is displayed using `Google Admob`.<br/>
Click on the movie you want to check and you will be taken to the movie's detail page<br/>
The detail page shows related information such as the movie introduction, director and actors.<br/>
If there is a YouTube trailer for the movie, you can watch it by going to the link.<br/>
If you click the Add to calendar button on the details page, the movie release date will be registered as a schedule in each device's calendar.<br/>
And when you press the Add Notification button, the app will send you a notification on the release date.<br/>
Registered notifications can be checked by clicking the bell button at the top right of the main page and can also be deleted from that page.<br/>
In the case of notifications, you can only add up to 2 notifications and if you need to add more later, you can register 1 additional notification when you watch the advertisement once.<br/>
